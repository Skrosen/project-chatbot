# Project Name

The assignment was to create a chatbot using pair progrmaming. The purpose of the chatbot was up to us to choose and we decided on a plantbot which we named Plot the plant bot.

## The problem

We started by formulate some questions and answers for our bot and we decided early in the process what theme we wanted for our chatbot. By participating in the weekly live sessions we got answers to many of our questions and issues. In our JavaScript we used variables, both constants and global, functions and conditionals. We also played around with ternary operators. 

If we had more time we would like to test out different input types, such as dropdown menus, radio buttons and so on.
